Fitness stuff:
    generally only use 8 out the 12 notes
    chords are made by skipping notes
    theres 3 notes that you play almost all the time (called chords), note 1, note 3, and note 5
        Notes 2,4,6 sounds really good together (8 is an octive higher than 1, higher pitch)
        3 5 7
        4 6 8
        G B D (in note form) this would be a good closer (another would be F A C)
        basically, skipping notes sounds good
    C-C is called an octive (8 notes in total)
    2 4 6 goes really nice into G B C
    sometimes we want G chord to go to A chord (less frequently)
    chords that overlap sounds good together
    major cadency sounds good 5-1 or 4-1
    6 and 3 are substitution chords for 1 (but don't start or end with them)
    try to not use the B chord (if the chord is B D F, pick a different chord) it sounds cool, but needs lots of rules around it
    chords 4 and 5 can substitute for each other
    chord 2 can sometimes be used instead of chord 4 or 5 (rarely)
    Never want to have more than 4 notes happen at one time (snare drum is included in that 4)

    We also want to limit repititon of stuff too
